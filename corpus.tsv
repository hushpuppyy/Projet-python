3	"CyberSec Quote of the Day: ""It's not the work; it's the worry of it."""	iansaul	2025-11-13T15:05:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ow1xt3/cybersec_quote_of_the_day_its_not_the_work_its/	I ran across this quote in a thread recently, and thought... that's exactly how I feel some weeks, working in this field. Doing the actual, technical, nitty-gritty parts is *generally enjoyable*, and occasionally awesome. But the incessant, nagging feeling that something, somewhere, is about to pop/have a critical CVE/a user or junior IT Admin will fug something up steals all the sunshine — and places a dark, angry little storm cloud perpetually over my shoulder, just waiting to strike. I'm sure waking up and reading The Hacker News/Cyber Security News feeds on Telegram don't help the situation... but then again... neither is Microsoft. Anyone else find it fitting? Have you come across other quotes that stand out and speak to the Sisyphean roles we fill? [https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/s/S0y2wzSF8D](https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/s/S0y2wzSF8D)		
4	Graduated, but I feel like I know nothing!	PickleOverlord1	2025-11-13T14:32:42	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ow160k/graduated_but_i_feel_like_i_know_nothing/	I recently graduated with a B.S. in Cybersecurity... got good grades and positive feedback from professors the entire time. Now that I'm on the other side, though, I feel like I know absolutely nothing. It's hard to tell whether this is imposter syndrome or a real problem. I'm currently working on my certifications. A+ is in the bag, studying for Network+. (I probably should have gotten these done while I was actively in school.) I think all of this studying is making me feel worse because it's reminding me about everything that didn't sink into my brain when I was in school. Has anybody else been in this situation? Do entry-level cyber jobs typically offer on-the-job training or will I be expected to hit the ground running? For context, I'm very tech-savvy. It's not like I'm starting from nothing.		
5	Beginner trying to learn cybersecurity where should I start?	kamelsalah1	2025-11-13T07:24:49	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ovtvae/beginner_trying_to_learn_cybersecurity_where/	Hey everyone, I’ve recently gotten interested in cybersecurity and I’m trying to figure out the best way to start learning. There’s so much info out there that it’s a bit overwhelming. I’m not from a tech background, but I’m willing to put in the time. Should I start with networking basics, Linux, or something else? Any good resources or beginner friendly paths you’d recommend? Appreciate any advice or tips from folks who’ve been down this road!		
6	Cybersecurity Stereotypes	Recent_Finding_6136	2025-11-13T03:24:03	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ovp6dj/cybersecurity_stereotypes/	I feel like people have these superfluous assumptions of cybersecurity professionals vigorously typing on their laptops, intercepting malware, and shutting down threats. Is reality really that cool? Or is it just a soul-sucking job?		
7	Cisco ASA Zero-Days Under Active Exploitation — CISA Issues Emergency Directive (Over 50k device exposed)	Overall_Reward963	2025-11-13T18:24:39	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ow73ik/cisco_asa_zerodays_under_active_exploitation_cisa/	Cisco ASA and FTD firewalls (CVE-2025-20333, CVE-2025-20362) are being actively exploited by a nation-state threat group. U.S. federal agencies have been ordered to isolate, patch, or remove affected devices immediately. Following Vulnerabilities are being exploited * **CVE-2025-20333:** Enables remote code execution via malicious VPN access. * **CVE-2025-20362:** Allows unauthenticated access to restricted URLs. Following key issues are observed: * Nearly **50,000 devices** are still exposed online, per multiple scans. * **CISA Directive 25-03** mandates immediate action across U.S. federal networks. * Malware families *RayInitiator* and *LINE VIPER* exhibit firmware-level persistence — even after reboot. Threat Actor UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849) is likely behind the attack Firewall and VPN gateways are the frontline of enterprise defense. Compromise here means an attacker can bypass internal segmentation, disable logs, and establish persistent access. The remediation might be complicated in this case. I am hoping these identified before Holidays		
8	Master Thesis ideas	red_hash	2025-11-12T14:57:12	https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ov5t5b/master_thesis_ideas/	Hi As the title suggests, I’ll be completing my master’s degree this year, and I d love to hear some ideas or suggestions from people working in the field of cybersec. Initially, I wanted to do something related to malware, specifically around ASLR bypassing but lately, it feels like everyone is doing something AI/LLM related. I’m still interested in low-level security and exploitation topics. Any ideas on how could I make this a master's thesis worthy topic without going to deep into it (like PhD level)? If you’ve seen any interesting research directions or unique thesis ideas in cybersecurity (offensive or defensive ), I’d really appreciate your input. Thanks!		
9	Developing a cyber security culture: Current practices and future needs	Betsy Uchendu	2021-06-28T13:31:33+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14701v1	While the creation of a strong security culture has been researched and discussed for decades, it continues to elude many businesses. Part of the challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent academic findings and research into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential factors across papers are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture. For research, we produce an up-to-date characterisation of the field and also define open issues deserving of further attention such as the role of change management processes and national culture in an enterprise's cyber security culture.
