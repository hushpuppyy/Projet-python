7	Assessing Cyber-Physical Security in Industrial Control Systems	Martín Barrère	2019-11-21T11:02:48+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09404v1	Over the last years, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have become increasingly exposed to a wide range of cyber-physical threats. Efficient models and techniques able to capture their complex structure and identify critical cyber-physical components are therefore essential. AND/OR graphs have proven very useful in this context as they are able to semantically grasp intricate logical interdependencies among ICS components. However, identifying critical nodes in AND/OR graphs is an NP-complete problem. In addition, ICS settings normally involve various cyber and physical security measures that simultaneously protect multiple ICS components in overlapping manners, which makes this problem even harder. In this paper, we present an extended security metric based on AND/OR hypergraphs which efficiently identifies the set of critical ICS components and security measures that should be compromised, with minimum cost (effort) for an attacker, in order to disrupt the operation of vital ICS assets. Our approach relies on MAX-SAT techniques, which we have incorporated in META4ICS, a Java-based security metric analyser for ICS. We also provide a thorough performance evaluation that shows the feasibility of our method. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through a case study in which we analyse the security posture of a realistic Water Transport Network (WTN).	arxiv	Chris Hankin, Demetrios G.

8	Towards Automated Cyber Range Design: Characterizing and Matching Demands to Supplies	Ekzhin Ear	2023-07-10T08:44:01+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04416v1	Cyber ranges mimic real-world cyber environments and are in high demand. Before building their own cyber ranges, organizations need to deeply understand what construction supplies are available to them. A fundamental supply is the cyber range architecture, which prompts an important research question: Which cyber range architecture is most appropriate for an organization's requirements? To answer this question, we propose an innovative framework to specify cyber range requirements, characterize cyber range architectures (based on our analysis of 45 cyber range architectures), and match cyber range architectures to cyber range requirements.	arxiv	Jose L.

9	Security Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review	Shaofei Huang	2024-04-11T07:41:36+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07527v3	Cyber-physical systems are at the intersection of digital technology and engineering domains, rendering them high-value targets of sophisticated and well-funded cybersecurity threat actors. Prominent cybersecurity attacks on CPS have brought attention to the vulnerability of these systems and the inherent weaknesses of critical infrastructure reliant on them. Security modelling for CPS is an important mechanism to systematically identify and assess vulnerabilities, threats, and risks throughout system life cycles, and to ultimately ensure system resilience, safety, and reliability. This survey delves into state-of-the-art research on CPS security modelling, encompassing both threat and attack modelling. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are different concepts. This paper elaborates on the differences between threat and attack modelling, examining their implications for CPS security. We conducted a systematic search that yielded 449 papers, from which 32 were selected and categorised into three clusters: those focused on threat modelling methods, attack modelling methods, and literature reviews. Specifically, we sought to examine what security modelling methods exist today, and how they address real-world cybersecurity threats and CPS-specific attacker capabilities throughout the life cycle of CPS, which typically span longer durations compared to traditional IT systems. This paper also highlights several limitations in existing research, wherein security models adopt simplistic approaches that do not adequately consider the dynamic, multi-layer, multi-path, and multi-agent characteristics of real-world cyber-physical attacks.	arxiv	Christopher M.

It has major implications for the cyber security industry. Existing cyber protection applications are working well, but there are still challenges and vulnerabilities in computer networks. Sometimes data and privacy are also compromised. These complications lead to research questions asking what kind of cyber protection applications of quantum computing are there and what potential methods or techniques can be used for cyber protection? These questions will reveal how much power quantum computing has and to what extent it can outperform the conventional computing systems. This scoping review was conducted by considering 815 papers. It showed the possibilities that can be achievedif quantum technologies are implemented in cyber environments. This scoping review discusses various domains such as algorithms and applications, bioinformatics, cloud and edge computing, the organization of complex systems, application areas focused on security and threats, and the broader quantum computing ecosystem. In each of these areas, there is significant scope for quantum computing to be implemented and to revolutionize the working environment. Numerous quantum computing applications for cyber protection and a number of techniques to protect our data and privacy were identified. The results are not limited to network security but also include data security. This paper also discusses societal aspects, e.g., the applications of quantum computing in the social sciences. This scoping review discusses how to enhance the efficiency and security of quantum computing in various cyber security domains. Additionally, it encourages the reader to think about what kind of techniques and methods can be deployed to secure the cyber world.	arxiv	Tuomo Sipola, Jari Hautamäki
11	Six Potential Game-Changers in Cyber Security: Towards Priorities in Cyber Science and Engineering	Alexander Kott	2015-11-02T14:13:24+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00509v1	The fields of study encompassed by cyber science and engineering are broad and poorly defined at this time. As national governments and research communities increase their recognition of the importance, urgency and technical richness of these disciplines, a question of priorities arises: what specific sub-areas of research should be the foci of attention and funding? In this paper we point to an approach to answering this question. We explore results of a recent workshop that postulated possible game-changers or disruptive changes that might occur in cyber security within the next 15 years. We suggest that such game-changers may be useful in focusing attention of research communities on high-priority topics. Indeed, if a drastic, important change is likely to occur, should we not focus our research efforts on the nature and ramifications of the phenomena pertaining to that change? We illustrate each of the game-changers examples of related current research, and then offer recommendations for advancement of cyber science and engineering with respect to each of the six game-changers.	arxiv	Ananthram Swami, Patrick McDaniel
12	Traffic-aware Patching for Cyber Security in Mobile IoT	Shin-Ming Cheng	2017-03-15T21:59:05+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05400v1	The various types of communication technologies and mobility features in Internet of Things (IoT) on the one hand enable fruitful and attractive applications, but on the other hand facilitates malware propagation, thereby raising new challenges on handling IoT-empowered malware for cyber security. Comparing with the malware propagation control scheme in traditional wireless networks where nodes can be directly repaired and secured, in IoT, compromised end devices are difficult to be patched. Alternatively, blocking malware via patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited patching resources and response time constraint. Experiments on real-world trace datasets in IoT networks are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed traffic-aware patching scheme in alleviating malware propagation.	arxiv	Pin-Yu Chen, Ching-Chao Lin, Hsu-Chun Hsiao
13	Assembling a Cyber Range to Evaluate Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) Security Tools	Jeffrey A. Nichols	2022-01-20T22:13:34+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08473v1	In this case study, we describe the design and assembly of a cyber security testbed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, TN, USA. The range is designed to provide agile reconfigurations to facilitate a wide variety of experiments for evaluations of cyber security tools -- particularly those involving AI/ML. In particular, the testbed provides realistic test environments while permitting control and programmatic observations/data collection during the experiments. We have designed in the ability to repeat the evaluations, so additional tools can be evaluated and compared at a later time. The system is one that can be scaled up or down for experiment sizes. At the time of the conference we will have completed two full-scale, national, government challenges on this range. These challenges are evaluating the performance and operating costs for AI/ML-based cyber security tools for application into large, government-sized networks. These evaluations will be described as examples providing motivation and context for various design decisions and adaptations we have made. The first challenge measured end-point security tools against 100K file samples (benignware and malware) chosen across a range of file types. The second is an evaluation of network intrusion detection systems efficacy in identifying multi-step adversarial campaigns -- involving reconnaissance, penetration and exploitations, lateral movement, etc. -- with varying levels of covertness in a high-volume business network. The scale of each of these challenges requires automation systems to repeat, or simultaneously mirror identical the experiments for each ML tool under test. Providing an array of easy-to-difficult malicious activity for sussing out the true abilities of the AI/ML tools has been a particularly interesting and challenging aspect of designing and executing these challenge events.	arxiv	Kevin D.

14	Challenges in Digital Twin Development for Cyber-Physical Production Systems	Heejong Park	2021-02-04T02:09:02+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03341v1	The recent advancement of information and communication technology makes digitalisation of an entire manufacturing shop-floor possible where physical processes are tightly intertwined with their cyber counterparts. This led to an emergence of a concept of digital twin, which is a realistic virtual copy of a physical object. Digital twin will be the key technology in Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and its market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Nevertheless, digital twin is still relatively a new concept that people have different perspectives on its requirements, capabilities, and limitations. To better understand an effect of digital twin's operations, mitigate complexity of capturing dynamics of physical phenomena, and improve analysis and predictability, it is important to have a development tool with a strong semantic foundation that can accurately model, simulate, and synthesise the digital twin. This paper reviews current state-of-art on tools and developments of digital twin in manufacturing and discusses potential design challenges.	arxiv	Arvind Easwaran, Sidharta Andalam
15	Identifying Security-Critical Cyber-Physical Components in Industrial Control Systems	Martín Barrère	2019-05-12T21:53:16+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04796v1	In recent years, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have become an appealing target for cyber attacks, having massive destructive consequences. Security metrics are therefore essential to assess their security posture. In this paper, we present a novel ICS security metric based on AND/OR graphs that represent cyber-physical dependencies among network components. Our metric is able to efficiently identify sets of critical cyber-physical components, with minimal cost for an attacker, such that if compromised, the system would enter into a non-operational state. We address this problem by efficiently transforming the input AND/OR graph-based model into a weighted logical formula that is then used to build and solve a Weighted Partial MAX-SAT problem. Our tool, META4ICS, leverages state-of-the-art techniques from the field of logical satisfiability optimisation in order to achieve efficient computation times. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed security metric can efficiently scale to networks with thousands of nodes and be computed in seconds. In addition, we present a case study where we have used our system to analyse the security posture of a realistic water transport network. We discuss our findings on the plant as well as further security applications of our metric.	arxiv	Chris Hankin, Nicolas Nicolau, Demetrios G. Eliades, Thomas Parisini
16	Learning-Assisted Secure End-to-End Network Slicing for Cyber-Physical Systems	Qiang Liu	2019-10-29T21:15:15+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13537v1	There is a pressing need to interconnect physical systems such as power grid and vehicles for efficient management and safe operations. Owing to the diverse features of physical systems, there is hardly a one-size-fits-all networking solution for developing cyber-physical systems. Network slicing is a promising technology that allows network operators to create multiple virtual networks on top of a shared network infrastructure. These virtual networks can be tailored to meet the requirements of different cyber-physical systems. However, it is challenging to design secure network slicing solutions that can efficiently create end-to-end network slices for diverse cyber-physical systems. In this article, we discuss the challenges and security issues of network slicing, study learning-assisted network slicing solutions, and analyze their performance under the denial-of-service attack. We also present a design and implementation of a small-scale testbed for evaluating the network slicing solutions.	arxiv	Tao Han, Nirwan Ansari

This paper explores the intersection of geopolitical dynamics, cyber threat intelligence analysis, and advanced detection technologies, with a focus on the energy domain. We leverage generative artificial intelligence to extract and structure information from raw cyber threat descriptions, enabling enhanced analysis. By conducting a geopolitical comparison of threat actor origins and target regions across multiple databases, we provide insights into trends within the general threat landscape. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of cybersecurity tools -- with particular emphasis on learning-based techniques -- in detecting indicators of compromise for energy-targeted attacks. This analysis yields new insights, providing actionable information to researchers, policy makers, and cybersecurity professionals.	arxiv	Ghada Elbez, Veit Hagenmeyer

Although ARL is the U.S. Army's corporate laboratory that focuses on fundamental and early applied research, the fundamental science endeavors are closely integrated with extensive operationally-oriented programs. One example is the Cyber Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) that brings together ARL scientists with academic researchers from dozens of U.S. universities. ARL cyber scientists are largely driven by challenges unique to the ground operations of the Army; this paper outlines a few of these challenges and the ways in which they are addressed by ARL research efforts. The long-term campaign of cyber research is guided by the vision of the future Army battlefield. In the year 2040, it will be a highly converged virtual-physical space, where cyber operations will be an integral part of the battle.	arxiv	
19	Towards Systematically Deriving Defence Mechanisms from Functional Requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems	Cheah Huei Yoong	2020-07-07T17:40:13+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03651v2	The threats faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure have motivated the development of different attack detection mechanisms, such as those that monitor for violations of invariants, i.e. properties that always hold in normal operation. Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.	arxiv	Venkata Reddy Palleti, Arlindo Silva, Christopher M.

An Analysis of Cybersecurity Challenges in the Shipping Industry	George Grispos	2022-08-07T00:49:36+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03607v1	Maritime shipping has become a trillion-dollar industry that now impacts the economy of virtually every country around the world. It is therefore no surprise that countries and companies have spent billions of dollars to modernize shipping vessels and ports with various technologies. However, the implementation of these technologies has also caught the attention of cybercriminals. For example, a cyberattack on one shipping company resulted in nearly $300 millions in financial losses. Hence, this paper describes cybersecurity vulnerabilities present in the international shipping business. The contribution of this paper is the identification and dissection of cyber vulnerabilities specific to the shipping industry, along with how and why these potential vulnerabilities exist.	arxiv	William R.

21	From Cyber Security Incident Management to Cyber Security Crisis Management in the European Union	Jukka Ruohonen	2025-04-19T08:03:29+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14220v2	Incident management is a classical topic in cyber security. Recently, the European Union (EU) has started to consider also the relation between cyber security incidents and cyber security crises. These considerations and preparations, including those specified in the EU's new cyber security laws, constitute the paper's topic. According to an analysis of the laws and associated policy documents, (i) cyber security crises are equated in the EU to large-scale cyber security incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states. For this and other purposes, (ii) the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including but not limited to the large-scale incidents. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, however, (iii) the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the EU-level. With these policy research results, the paper advances the domain of cyber security incident management research by elaborating how European law perceives cyber security crises and their relation to cyber security incidents, paving the way for many relevant further research topics with practical relevance, whether theoretical, conceptual, or empirical.	arxiv	Kalle Rindell, Simone Busetti
22	On Autonomous Agents in a Cyber Defence Environment	Mitchell Kiely	2023-09-14T02:09:36+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07388v1	Autonomous Cyber Defence is required to respond to high-tempo cyber-attacks. To facilitate the research in this challenging area, we explore the utility of the autonomous cyber operation environments presented as part of the Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenges, with a specific focus on CAGE Challenge 2. CAGE Challenge 2 required a defensive Blue agent to defend a network from an attacking Red agent. We provide a detailed description of the this challenge and describe the approaches taken by challenge participants. From the submitted agents, we identify four classes of algorithms, namely, Single- Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Hierarchical DRL, Ensembles, and Non-DRL approaches. Of these classes, we found that the hierarchical DRL approach was the most capable of learning an effective cyber defensive strategy. Our analysis of the agent policies identified that different algorithms within the same class produced diverse strategies and that the strategy used by the defensive Blue agent varied depending on the strategy used by the offensive Red agent. We conclude that DRL algorithms are a suitable candidate for autonomous cyber defence applications.	arxiv	David Bowman, Maxwell Standen, Christopher Moir
23	Cyber-Zero: Training Cybersecurity Agents without Runtime	Terry Yue Zhuo	2025-07-29T18:10:37+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00910v2	Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments, particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model, Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.	arxiv	Dingmin Wang, Hantian Ding, Varun Kumar, Zijian Wang
24	Perspectives of Non-Expert Users on Cyber Security and Privacy: An Analysis of Online Discussions on Twitter	Nandita Pattnaik	2022-06-05T11:54:48+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02156v2	Current research on users` perspectives of cyber security and privacy related to traditional and smart devices at home is very active, but the focus is often more on specific modern devices such as mobile and smart IoT devices in a home context. In addition, most were based on smaller-scale empirical studies such as online surveys and interviews. We endeavour to fill these research gaps by conducting a larger-scale study based on a real-world dataset of 413,985 tweets posted by non-expert users on Twitter in six months of three consecutive years (January and February in 2019, 2020 and 2021). Two machine learning-based classifiers were developed to identify the 413,985 tweets. We analysed this dataset to understand non-expert users` cyber security and privacy perspectives, including the yearly trend and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied topic modelling, sentiment analysis and qualitative analysis of selected tweets in the dataset, leading to various interesting findings. For instance, we observed a 54% increase in non-expert users` tweets on cyber security and/or privacy related topics in 2021, compared to before the start of global COVID-19 lockdowns (January 2019 to February 2020). We also observed an increased level of help-seeking tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert users across the three years, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, financial security, and security and privacy issues involving different stakeholders. Overall negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics non-expert users discussed on Twitter in all the three years. Our results confirm the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users` perspectives on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on different facets of such perspectives.	arxiv	Shujun Li, Jason R.

Therefore, in the same way that biological systems develop immunity as a way to respond to infections and other attacks, so too must cyber systems adapt to ever-changing threats that continue to attack vital system functions, and to bounce back from the effects of the attacks. Here, we explain the basic concepts of resilience in the context of systems, discuss related properties, and make business case of cyber resilience. We also offer a brief summary of ways to assess cyber resilience of a system, and approaches to improving cyber resilience.	arxiv	Alexander Kott
26	Cyber Security Awareness Campaigns: Why do they fail to change behaviour?	Maria Bada	2019-01-09T10:45:57+00:00	https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02672v1	The present paper focuses on Cyber Security Awareness Campaigns, and aims to identify key factors regarding security which may lead them to failing to appropriately change people's behaviour. Past and current efforts to improve information-security practices and promote a sustainable society have not had the desired impact. It is important therefore to critically reflect on the challenges involved in improving information-security behaviours for citizens, consumers and employees. In particular, our work considers these challenges from a Psychology perspective, as we believe that understanding how people perceive risks is critical to creating effective awareness campaigns. Changing behaviour requires more than providing information about risks and reactive behaviours - firstly, people must be able to understand and apply the advice, and secondly, they must be motivated and willing to do so - and the latter requires changes to attitudes and intentions. These antecedents of behaviour change are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review the suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used 'fear appeals'. From this range of literature, we extract essential components for an awareness campaign as well as factors which can lead to a campaign's success or failure. Finally, we present examples of existing awareness campaigns in different cultures (the UK and Africa) and reflect on these.	arxiv	Angela M. Sasse, Jason R. C. Nurse
