Hey everyone! I'm Ashu - one of the co-founders at TryHackMe. I have background in security consulting/penetrating test, specialising in Cloud / AWS. Happy to answer any and all questions about cyber skills gaps, but for more focused convos - here's a few areas top of mind for me - so feel free to throw any Qs related to this \* Rise of Al in security environments and how this is going to impact the skills of cyber security professionals \* Supporting people with their journey to getting a role in cyber \* Thinking deeply about what it means for SOC and IR teams to develop and improve their maturity as a function I am small business owner in construction. I got interested in cloud security recently, started to build my lab, complete tryhackme rooms, watch Professor Messer, I feel like it would make sense to open my own company in this field one day. But for that I will need way more experience besides what I am doing now. And seems I will need to land a job one day to practice. I make good money at my business but I am so curious about cybersecurity. I guess my question is: is it possible to passively learn say cloud security, earn certs and one day get a mid lvl job in the field skipping all entry levels. I understand, job market is tuff and over saturated, but maybe there are people who eventually shifted careers making cybersecurity as a hobby? Would love to hear some stories Before the comments I have sec+, CySA+ and 3 IT & Cyber internships Im sorry to all you cyber students. The industry is beyond cooked I’ve applied to NY,DMV,NC,SC,VA I’ve had 4 interviews and got a reject email from about 30-40 1 for a digital forensics role - 2 interviews, 1 in person and got ghosted 😂 1 for a cyber security role - 2 interviews and they said they are not looking for a intern anymore 1 for IBM - ghosted after first round 1 I turned because it was IT and I’m already interning in IT I know I’ll get hate comments but for all you students you need to know someone. These people post the listings and already have the position filled. Good luck Psa- some of these are for summer internships and are not asking people for interviews yet. Hi all, looking for some advice from the community. I have an advanced diploma in cybersecurity and digital investigations and several industry certifications (including CHFI, Security+, GFACT, GSEC, GCIH, GPEN, and eCPPTv3). I’ve been working in security operations and engineering roles for a few years and plan to pursue OSCP and BSCP certifications in the next couple of years. I don’t currently have a bachelor’s degree, but I have the option to enroll in a BTech in Forensic Investigation: Digital Forensics & Cybersecurity, which I could complete in 2 years while working. The tuition can be covered by my employer, but I’d have to sign a contract to stay with the company for 2 years if I go this route. My main goal is to advance my career, earn more, and reach reputable positions in cybersecurity. Given my experience and certifications, do I *really* need a bachelor’s degree, or would it make more sense to continue focusing on certifications and practical experience? I am working on my final project for a Cybersecurity certificate. The topic of the project is remote code execution. The incident i'm reporting on involves a team of ethical hackers gaining access to a file management server using a block of JSON. This block of JSON contains an action parameter that calls a function to "fetchRemoteFile". The malicious file was then written to an arbitrary path on the server being attacked. My question is: Once the malicious file is saved to the server being attacked, and the attacker then begins to manipulate files, steal data, etc., does this reverse shell need to stay connected in order for the attacker to continue its malicious behavior? Do they need to reestablish the connection everytime? What purpose does the malicious file serve? Does IT allow the attacker easier access next time they decide to conduct this activity? Help me understand this better. Here is a link to the article: [What’s That Coming Over The Hill? (Monsta FTP Remote Code Execution CVE-2025-34299)](https://labs.watchtowr.com/whats-that-coming-over-the-hill-monsta-ftp-remote-code-execution-cve-2025-34299/) I have often wondered how many people flip from the good guys to the bad. Many of the main big tech companies plop AI onto everything and invest heavily. My cybersecurity companies offer AI security solutions but don’t necessarily build data centers or their own AI models. Do you see cybersecurity companies being more stable than other tech companies when the AI bubble pops? I was cleaning up my dependencies last month and realized ChatGPT had suggested "rails-auth-token" to me. Sounds legit, right? Doesn't exist on RubyGems. The scary part: if I'd pushed that to GitHub, an attacker could register it with malware and I'd install it on my next build. Research shows AI assistants hallucinate non-existent packages 5-21% of the time. I built SlopGuard to catch this before installation. It: * Verifies packages actually exist in registries (RubyGems, PyPI, Go modules) * Uses 3-stage trust scoring to minimize false positives * Detects typosquats and namespace attacks * Scans 700+ packages in 7 seconds Tested on 1000 packages: 2.7% false positive rate, 96% detection on known supply chain attacks. Built in Ruby, about 2500 lines, MIT licensed.

Most devs don't verify AI suggestions before using them.
